# Chat app

This project was created for testing ngrx.

## Development server

Run `npm run api-server` for a dev server. After that run `npm start` in another terminal window and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
